## Loan Prediction Project

### Overview
This project involves developing a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan approval for applicants. By analyzing various features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more, the model aims to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

### Objectives
- **Predict Loan Approval:** Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant data.
- **Feature Analysis:** Analyze key features that influence loan approval decisions.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms in predicting loan approvals.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project includes information on applicants, such as income, loan amount, credit history, and marital status. This data is sourced from a loan application database.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** Programming language used for data analysis and model development.
- **Pandas:** Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Library used for numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library used for model development and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Libraries used for data visualization.

### Project Structure
- **data/:** Directory containing the dataset.
- **notebooks/:** Directory containing Jupyter notebooks with the analysis and model development.
- **src/:** Directory containing source code for data processing, feature engineering, and model training.
- **README.md:** File providing an overview of the project and instructions for running the analysis.

### Key Insights
- **Credit History:** Identified as the most significant feature influencing loan approval.
- **Income Level:** Higher applicant income generally increases the likelihood of loan approval.
- **Loan Amount:** Larger loan amounts have a lower probability of being approved, especially for applicants with lower income.

### Usage
To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/rootsubhradeep/Loan_Prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Loan_Prediction`
3. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to view the analysis and model development.
